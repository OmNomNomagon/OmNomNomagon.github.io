Create maximum rigidity through a sturdy 3030 Aluminium extrusion frame. Allow for future proofing and commonality of parts by basing all printed parts on the current Original Prusa MK3 files. Reduce the weight of the X and Y carriages where possible to improve print speed and quality.  The Wanhao i3 is a fabulous printer, but new generations of printers have begun pushing the boundaries. It has become apparent that in comparison, the Wanhao has a few deficiencies. Deficiencies which we will address in this project. The key improvements of this upgrade include:\n Much better rigidity through 3030 extrusions and metal brackets. Even with my or Azza’s excellent z braces the printer was still susceptible to slight wobble, especially under twisting forces (pull left tower and push right tower). When moving the printer it would require constant releveling due these small movements. Now i can barely get any movement using my full strength. Comfortably increase Z height to ~200mm Reduce noise. By not screwing the motors directly onto the metal frame, motor vibrations and noise is reduced significantly. Move towards more standard Prusa files for future upgradability, but with added strength improvements. Modular hotend, This design allows for the hotend to be replaced easily replaced without disassembling the printer. I have created a Titan Aero mount as an alternative to the original MK10 with a E3DV6 mount incoming. Sturdier 4 bearing Prusa style X-gantry. Not sure if it was specific to my printer or a common Wanhao problem, but my X gantry always had a lot of wobble which may have been a source of printing artifacts. Noticeably better print quality due to a combination of everything above. I am able to print faster with better quality. All Wanhao i3 variants and rebrands are compatible, however the plus will require additional work to create an enclosure for the electronics. This project can also be built from scratch, or salvaged from other printers as long as measurements are altered accordingly.  Sample Print @~100mm/s on the titan aero extruder.\nSample of improved print quality. 0.24mm layer height @ 70mm/s (titan aero).\nThis project will be maintained both at github and at thingiverse. The files were created using a combination of Fusion360 and tinkercad. They can be viewed and edited via this Tinkercad link.\nTable Of Contents  1. Bill Of Materials 2.

Sturdier cable cover box. Added 1Meter GT2 belt to BOM as the stock belt may not be long enough (can anyone confirm?)\n1.02 - Updated the Part Fan Bracket to Part Fan Bracket V1.1 The original doesn\u0026rsquo;t align with the carriage plates properly. Please print the revised one.\n1.03 - Uploaded a new Y Carriage Belt Holder. This one is based on the current MK3 design and is much easier to fix and tension.\n1.04 - X Gantry Idler 9MM V2 was missing the heat-sert insert holes to mount the cable box. Updated and fixed with X Gantry Idler 9MM V3. If you have already printed V2, you can keep the part and manually drill 2x 4mm holes spaced 9mm wide and 6mm deep.\n1.1 - 11/03/2018 Major Prusa MK3 Update. This updates an update of many of the original MK2s based parts to MK3 Based parts. This includes;\n  MK3 Based Part Cooling shroud and mount. It performs much better than the original Thorped based one. flawless @60 degree overhang with some sagging @70 degree overhang. The original would show artefacts @60 degrees.. Almost comparable to the Dii Cooler.\n  Much improved X Carriage. This uses the new MK3 belt mounting method which is much easier to install under tension. The whole extruder assembly can now also easily slide on and off the rods to greatly simplify installation and maintenance. 16mm M3 screws are used to secure the bearings. I\u0026rsquo;ve also made and tested changes which allow the extruder assembly to be built without heat-serts and can be substituted with M3 nylocks. NOTE: due to these changes the Rear carriage plate is NOT compatible with the existing Front extruder plate as the hole spacing has been changed. The New Front extruder plate must be used.\n  Front Extruder Plate. Better spacing around the hotend to improve the filament path. Updating Hole Spacing to be compatible with the new Rear Carriage Plate. Strengthened BLTouch mount. Increase spacing around heater block to reduce residual heat. Not compatible with old extruder plate.\n  X Axis Motor Mount. Incorporates the new MK3 design. Better Spacing to ensure a straighter belt path. Includes new MK3 tensioner to easily tension X belt. Requires M3nS Nut and 20mm M3 screw. (Enough tension can be applied by without the M3nS) Installation is similar to the Prusa instructions here, steps 11-18.\n  As this project contains dozens of files already, Older retired files are retired to the Retired Versions directory in github\n  1.1.1 - Endstop Part For sensorless homing with TMC2130 Drivers.\n1.2 - 05/11/2018 - Multiple improvements based on Prusa MK3 R3 release. This includes:\n  Prusa MK3 R3 based part cooling shroud. This gives a noticeable improvement over the original shroud. Also improved the clearance between the shroud and the nozzle.\n  Improved X Carriage rear plate. This was strengthend to better handle bumps and knocks. Rigidity is also improved. It is still a common part between the MK10 and titan aero extruders.\n  Strengthened Z Rod Securer parts. Some people had issues with these snapping in PLA but should no longer be an issue.\n  1.3 - 17/02/2020 - E3D Hemera mount. Updated fan duct to the most recent R4 release. Added an angle for increased rear fan duct clearance. This will filter down to the other hotend designs shortly. Initial update of parts across to fusion 360. A number of parts have been converted and this will continue over time.\nImproved cable mounting system by clipping onto the X axis motor\n1.3.1 - 19/02/2020 - MK52 Removeable heatbed Mod - resized rods and extrusions to accommodate the prusa MK3 heatbed.\nNext 1.

The legs and printed corner parts are all based on the misumi hole spacing HPTLS6.\n  4x LM8UU Bearings. These replace the stock Z bearings. It is also worthwhile purchasing some of the longer LM8LUU bearing to replace the X and Y axises if you are coming from a pre 2.1 wanhao. These misumi ones are much higher quality than the originals.

Some drop in T-Nuts have a longer neck which can cause issues with the Misumi HBLFSNB6 corner brackets. One side of the bracket is protruded, so that even when screwed in very tightly they don\u0026rsquo;t apply enough compression force to secure the frame. In this case 14 T-nuts can be substituted with flat style ones, or pieces of fibre washers can be glued into the grooved areas to reduce the protrusion depth.

This includes the hotend screws, and the M4 x-carriage screws.\n  (Optional) 2x M5 Smooth Idler Pulleys. The original Wanhao pulleys are prone to failure over time and are 11mm wide. i recommend switching them out with new ones while doing this mod. Most replecement ones are 9mm wide which allows you to use the X Gantry Idler 9MM part instead of the X Gantry Idler 11mm (Stock idler) part. The 9mm version has thicker walls which should make it more durable over time.\n  3-10 M5 washers (Steel or fibrous). Used to secure the X and Y idlers. Variable number required depending on their thickness and whether you are using stock idlers or the usually thinner aftermarket ones.\n  1 Meter of GT2 6mm belt.

It results in much better overhang performance. 60 degree overhangs are flawless with some sagging @70 degrees. It is almost comparable to the Dii Cooler via testing.\nMake sure your Re-duplicator idler part is the new V2 design it includes additional mounting points for the X endstop. The X-axis endstop is mounted on the bottom of the X-axis idler part. The endstop will need to be relocated to the middle or furthest holes depending on the positioning of your heatbed.

The Z height and width profiles are minimized while keeping it as strong and light as possible. The Hemera is a wide extruder / hotend system with an offset mount which made it a challenge to design a mount that kept full x axis usability.\nThis mount is designed primarily for the ReDuplicator MK3sx which started life as a Wanhao Duplicator i3. Unfortunately due to the Hemera size and and offset, the common ReDuplicator x-carriage used for the MK10 and titan could not be carried across. The original ReDuplicator files are available here. Although the mount is designed for the ReDuplicator, it should also be compatible with the Prusa MK3/s with some small changes to trigger the TMC endstops correctly.\nThe new fan shroud is based on the Prusa MK3s R4 duct. It results in much better overhangs and more consistent performance than the R3 and R2 Prusa fan ducts.\nPlease ensure sure your Re-duplicator idler part is the new V2 or newer design as it includes additional mounting points for the X endstop. The X-axis endstop is mounted on the bottom of the X-axis idler part. However if you\u0026rsquo;ve already printed the original idler V1, new holes can be drilled in at 5mm intervals with a 1.5mm drill bit. I highly recommend upgrading to TMC steppers for this as it is much easier to setup with sensorless homing.\nThe printed parts should be a minimum of 3 perimeters and 20%+ infill.

Four Heatserts are placed into the back of the extruder plate.\nTwo optional heat serts are inserted into the front of the carriage. This is only required if you intend to use the MK3s optical filament sensor.\nFollow the Hemera core and direct assembly guides here The Hemera is mounted to the plate with the provided 4 bolts. I recommend re terminating all wires in order to make maintenance and swapping the hotend assembly easier. Dupont connectors are perfect for most wires and spade connectors are used for the hotend. The stepper motor wiring can be fed through the provided channel and fed through the underside.\nThe carriage can then side onto the X axis. The 3 bearings can slide into the bearing slots. Use the 20-25mm M3 screws and nylocks to secure the bearings. Be sure not to over tighten these screws, ensure the pressure on the bearings is even and the carriage should slide freely.\nThe fan mount connects to the fan shroud via a 10mm M3 bolt and Nylock. The 50mm blower fan is connected with the 30mm M4, Nylock and soft washer. The soft washer in between will help to reduce vibrating fan noise. Once the heating block is centered properly, connect the cooling fan duct to the carriage with 2x 8-10mm m3 screws into the bottom most mounting holes.\nThe X Axis belt is installed the same as the Prusa MK3s. See those instructions for further details if required. The X axis motor should be loosened and rotated inwards, This allows the belt to be pushed into the slots. A flathead screwdriver may help. The motor can then be rotated back and tensioned.\nThe Bltouch mount is connected to the motor with 4x 8mm countersunk screws. 2x 10mm M3 screws mount the Bltouch to the mount.\nConnect all your wiring and the wiring chain with 2x 8mm countersunk M3 screws.\nConnect the endstop to the bottom of the X axis idler pulley with 2x 8mm M2 screws. There are a number of different mounting holes. Use the ones which get the nozzle closest to the corner of the heatbed without overhanginging it.\nSome software changes are required.

The original Prusa MK3s guides are also a valuable resource.\nAssembly The Base is made up of the 278mm Extrusions in the X direction and 355mm in the X Direction.\nThe underside crossbeam is a 340mm extrusion. Its final position depends on your exact setup so leave it slightly loose till the best of the build is finalized. For example, when using a Hemera hotend with TMC sensorless homing, the crossbeam should be 185mm from the front of the base.\nThe Z Tower is made up of 430mm extrusions. In this version the vertical extrusion go all the way to the top and bottom, which makes it much easier to add the corner brackets and rod holding tower parts.\nThe Z motor mounts should be mounted 42mm from the base of the Z tower. The top of the Y axis Idler should be mounted 118mm across the front extrusion and the top of the Y motor mount should be 108mm across the rear extrusion. For the MK10 and Titan aero these can be set 10mm further to the right.\nThe 380mm rods are mounted on the Y axis, 330mm rods on the z axis and 370 rods in the Y axis.\nThe Z Top Rod holding pieces should be flush with the edge and the top of the tower extrusions. The distance between the Z axis rods is 396mm.\nThe Y axis rods are press fit into the X idler and X motor pieces. There are small windows to ensure the rods are inserted fully.\nInsert the bearings into the Y bearing holders. use the flanged bearing blocks if you are using normal LM8U bearings or use the non flanged version if using longer LM8UU bearings. M3 Nylocks are press fit into the blocks and secured to the Y carriage with 22mm-25mm M3 bolts and washers screwed in from the top.\nThe Y Belt holder requires 2 m3 nylocks to be press fit into it. It is mounted to the Y carriage on the side of the Y motor mount with a 10mm-12mm M3 bolt and nylock. The Y Belt Tensioner is attached to the other side and a nylock is press fit on the side. The belt is mounted by looping the belt around a 12mm m3 screw and slowly screwing it in. Once the belt is properly in the channels a 35mm M3 screw between the Belt holder and tensioner is tightened to tension the belt properly.\nThe MK52 heatbed can then be installed. There are 9 mounting holes. Use the countersunk 12mm screw and 6mm spacer for the middle mount. For each of the other mounting holes use a 12mm countersunk M3 along with a nylock nut. This allows precise leveling of the heatbed.\nThe heatbed must be soldered in order to be low profile enough that it doesn\u0026rsquo;t collide with the hotend cooling system. Feed the wires from below through the holes and solder directly to the board trying to keep it as flat as possible.\nInstall the heatbed cover using the fasteners provided with the heatbed. This should be 3x 10mm bolts and 3 M3 nuts. If done correctly, the heatbed cover bump should be well below the extruder assembly and cooling fan during leveling and printing.\nThe rest of the installation proceeds as a normal ReDuplicator build.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"2a90ead423f02f7a85b55dc8238a704b","permalink":"https://riganti.com.au/docs/mk3x/page8/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/docs/mk3x/page8/","section":"docs","summary":"The final piece of recreating the Prusa MK3s magic is the fantastic removable spring steel PEI magnetic heatbed.

The vertical chain should contain 22 links + the 2 end links. The horizontally moving chain should contain 25 links + the two end links. The last 2 links in this chain should be reversed, to reduce the stain on the cables.\nThe X-Axis endstop is now mounted underneath the X-axis Idler Part. The endstop should be disconnected and the wire pulled out of the top cable chain length so that it only passed through the bottom cable chain. This reduces the weight and strain on the x-axis.\nFrom v1.3 a new cable routing method is preferred. The cables can be routed from the base to the hotend using the Cable Guide Bottom Mount 360 to hold the bottom of the vertical cable chain.\nThe top of the vertical drag chain should connect to Cable Guide Alternate - Motor Mount 360 with 2x 8mm countersunk m3 screws.

The bottom of the horizontal drag chain connects to this part and the other end can be screwed directly into the back of the extruder carriage.\nIn the pic above you can make out the two reversed chain links.

Unfortunately sore ears are inevitable after a few hours. This adapter allows over ear style earpads to be used.\nThis gives much better comfort for extended listening sessions, better noise isolation in noisy environments and after some tweaking sound better than the stock pads.\nIt is 100% tested and confirmed compatible with the ES10\u0026rsquo;s but should also work with other headphones in the ES series.\nIt is designed around AH-MSR7 earpads but should also work with Sennheiser momentum over ear pads and Audio Technica M40/M50 Series pads. The pads I used are non authentic clones which are available for cheap on eBay and aliexpress etc. They may sound different than genuine MSR7 pads.\nThe sound signature is changed fairly drastically. Using MSR7 Pads without any alterations on the ES10 causes a larger soundstage, sharper treble and very slightly recessed mids.\nThe ideal combination is a sheet of 3ply toilet paper between the driver and the earpad. This tames the treble peak, brings back the midrange, while the bass impact and soundstage is retained. It sounds better than the stock ES10 in my opinion and also possibly better than the ES10 with ESW11 sheepskin earpads. In conjunction with the increased comfort it is a very worthwhile mod.\nThinner pads will probably alter the sound signature the least as they position the head close to the original earpads. Thicker and angled pads will create a bigger soundstage, but can cause changes to treble. This can be managed surprisingly well with toilet paper.\nDownload Downloadable on thingiverse\n","date":1582072500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582072500,"objectID":"3cf07f896c22b0f00eb6e9cf41608c0a","permalink":"https://riganti.com.au/build/es10/","publishdate":"2020-02-19T00:35:00Z","relpermalink":"/build/es10/","section":"build","summary":"Over ear pad mod","tags":["audio","3d"],"title":"Audio Technica ES10 Overear Pads Mod","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1582072500,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1582072500,"objectID":"739569000ea5fa372d4d41e79f330e58","permalink":"https://riganti.com.au/project/kb2/","publishdate":"2020-02-19T00:35:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/kb2/","section":"project","summary":"Gateron Brown Switches","tags":["electro"],"title":"Custom Drevo Calibre","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"A modified Drevo Calibur Keyboard with the following mods:\n Gateron Brown Switches, oiled silenced stabilizers PBT white kkeycaps O-ring silencers Matt dampening in enclosure.
